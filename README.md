# VBA-Challenge
VBA Challenge
- This is my VBA-Challenge. I have stored the code for the challenge in the Multiple_Year_Stock_data xlsm file. The Macro with the code is called "Ticker"
- On the first sheet, titled Q1, I inserted a button to run the macro along all sheets. If you press the button the Macro "Run this Macro" will run. 
- I have also attached 4 screenshots for the results, titled Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4. 
Regarding my code itself, I worked on my code with 2 separate tutors. 
The first tutor I worked with's name is CJ and the second tutor I worked with's name is Lucas. 
I also utilized the Xpert Learning Assistant to help with debugging my code and helping correct some of the syntax errors I was encountering. 
Finally I worked with the professor and the TA Joly to help with debugging.
